## üîç About

This repository will contain the Jupyter notebooks I'm creating while taking the ["Machine Learning A-Z" Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wci3@B_506gfZUaTAInaUrIfJgw8vPbi7wUc0n63ZG9qeAJridsQZpVfKO_UcHd0D9FJXPQ==/).

To follow along with the course and practice on my own, I scraped Twitter data to apply the different tools learned in the course to my dataset.

I'll be using this dataset throughout the different notebooks to practice with every ML subject.

## üöÄ Content

[1Ô∏è‚É£ Obtaining Data Notebook](notebooks/obtaining_data.ipynb): I used a **Twitter scraper** to extract information on the tweets of 4 ML accounts I like (with different audiences and styles). I additionally obtained the tweet's **sentiment** to add it to the features. 

[2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing Notebook](notebooks/Data%20Preprocessing/Python/data_preprocessing_tools.ipynb): In this notebook, I called the scraped data, selected the features for a regression problem and separated them from the dependent variable, encoded categorical variables, split the data into training and testing, and scaled the numerical features.
